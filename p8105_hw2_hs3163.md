## Problem 1

This problem uses the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset, available as an Excel
file on the course website.

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries (rows
with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using arguments in
read\_excel use reasonable variable names omit rows that do not include
dumpster-specific data round the number of sports balls to the nearest
integer and converts the result to an integer variable (using
as.integer)

**Answer**

``` r
##Read Mr. Trash Wheel sheet, Ommiting the Column O and the header image.=
Mr_Trash_Wheel <- read_excel(path = "./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",range = "A2:N336")
Mr_Trash_Wheel_cleaned <- Mr_Trash_Wheel%>%
##Remove the rows that don't contains row specific data
drop_na(Dumpster) %>%
##Change month into factor
  janitor::clean_names()%>%
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))%>%
##all the typr of trash are actually one variable
  pivot_longer(plastic_bottles:sports_balls,names_to = "trash_type", values_to = "trash_count")%>%
##Trash type shall be factor for easier data analysis
    mutate(trash_type = factor(trash_type)) %>%
###To avoid confusion, rename
  rename( all_type_weight_in_tons = weight_tons, 
          all_type_volumn_in_cubic_yards = volume_cubic_yards,
          all_type_homes_powered = homes_powered)
```

Read and clean precipitation data for 2017 and 2018. For each, omit rows
without precipitation data and add a variable year. Next, combine
precipitation datasets and convert month to a character variable (the
variable month.name is built into R and should be useful).
**Answer**

``` r
Precipitation_2018<- read_excel(path = "./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",sheet = "2018 Precipitation",range = "A2:B9")

Precipitation_2017<- read_excel(path = "./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",sheet = "2017 Precipitation",range = "A2:B14")
ncol(Precipitation_2018)
```

    ## [1] 2

``` r
###Clean up the data for 2018
Precipitation_2018<-Precipitation_2018 %>% 
  rename( "Total Precipitation" = Total)%>%
  mutate(year = 2018)%>%
  mutate(Month = month.name[Month])%>%
  janitor::clean_names()

###Clean up the data for 2017
Precipitation_2017<-Precipitation_2017 %>% 
  rename( "Total Precipitation" = Total)%>%
  mutate(year = 2017)%>%
  mutate(Month = month.name[Month])%>%
  janitor::clean_names()

##Stack the two datas.
Precipitation_2017_2018 <-bind_rows(Precipitation_2017,Precipitation_2018)
Precipitation_2017_2018
```

Write a paragraph about these data; you are encouraged to use inline R.
Be sure to note the number of observations in both resulting datasets,
and give examples of key variables. For available data, what was the
total precipitation in 2018? What was the median number of sports balls
in a dumpster in 2017?

**Answer** The number of observations in the first resulting datasets is
334. The number of observations in the second resulting datasets is 19.
One key variable for the first table is the date, as the trash count for
all the trash type except for glass bottles and cigarette increase till
the middle of 2016 and then gradually drop. That said, another key
variable will therefore be the type of trash as different types of trash
have different pattern on their trash count over time.

The key variables to second result tabel are the variable month and
year,for as time progress the total precipitation changes alone with it.

For key variables in terms of indexing, the key variable for both data
set are year and month for they combined can be used to identified a
unique record in the second table to into the first one.

The total precipitation in 2018 is 23.5. The median number of sports
balls in a dumpster in 2017 is 8

## Problem 2

First, clean the data in pols-month.csv. Use separate() to break up the
variable mon into integer variables year, month, and day; replace month
number with month name; create a president variable taking values gop
and dem, and remove prez\_dem and prez\_gop; and remove the day
variable.

**Answer**

``` r
##Read the data set
pols_month<-read_csv(file = "./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv")%>%
##separate the mon variable.
separate(col = mon, into = c("year", "month","day"), sep = "-")%>%
##Change the month in to number, and then map the correspond month name on it.
  mutate(month = factor(month.name[as.numeric(month)]))%>%
##Since president is either gop or dem, in prez_gop there is misentered value :2, so prez_dem will be used as ref
  mutate(presidents = factor(prez_dem, labels = c("gop","dem")))%>%
  ##Since year is a number, change year into numeric
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))%>%
##Remove the unneeded columns.
  select(-prez_dem,-prez_gop,-day)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

Second, clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the above.
For consistency across datasets, arrange according to year and month,
and organize so that year and month are the leading columns.

**Answer**

``` r
##Read the data set
snp<-read_csv(file = "./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv")%>%
##separate the date variable.
separate(col = date, into = c("month","day","year"), sep = "/")%>%
##Change the month in to number, and then map the correspond month name on it.
  mutate(month = factor(month.name[as.numeric(month)]))%>%
  ##Since year is a number, change year into numeric
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))%>%
##Remove the unneeded columns and arrange the column.
  select(year, month, close)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

Third, tidy the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the
previous datasets. This process will involve switching from “wide” to
“long” format; ensuring that key variables have the same name; and
ensuring that key variables take the same
values.

**Answer**

``` r
unemployment <-read_csv(file = "./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>%
pivot_longer(Jan:Dec,names_to = "month", values_to = "unemployment_rate")%>%
  ##Change the month into number
  mutate(month = match(month,month.abb)) %>%
  ##Change the month into full name
  mutate(month = factor(month.name[month])) %>%
  ##Change the year type into character
  rename(year = Year) %>%
  ##Rearrange the order
  select(year,month,unemployment_rate)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Year = col_double(),
    ##   Jan = col_double(),
    ##   Feb = col_double(),
    ##   Mar = col_double(),
    ##   Apr = col_double(),
    ##   May = col_double(),
    ##   Jun = col_double(),
    ##   Jul = col_double(),
    ##   Aug = col_double(),
    ##   Sep = col_double(),
    ##   Oct = col_double(),
    ##   Nov = col_double(),
    ##   Dec = col_double()
    ## )

Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment
into the result.

``` r
pols_snp_month<- left_join(pols_month,snp, by = c("year","month") )
pols_snp_unemployment_per_month <- left_join(pols_snp_month,unemployment,by = c("year","month")  )
pols_snp_unemployment_per_month
```

Write a short paragraph about these datasets. Explain briefly what each
dataset contained, and describe the resulting dataset (e.g. give the
dimension, range of years, and names of key variables).

**Answer**

The pols-month data set contains 822 observations of the number of
democratic or republican politicians at president, governer, and senator
levels for any given montns within the range of Jan 1947 to Jun 2015.

## Problem 3

Load and tidy the data. Note that, although these data may seem fairly
well formatted initially, the names of a categorical predictor and the
case structure of string variables changed over time; you’ll need to
address this in your data cleaning. Also, some rows seem duplicated, and
these will need to be removed (hint: google something like “dplyr remove
duplicate rows” to get started).

``` r
Popular_Baby_Names <-read_csv(file = "./data/Popular_Baby_Names.csv") 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   `Year of Birth` = col_double(),
    ##   Gender = col_character(),
    ##   Ethnicity = col_character(),
    ##   `Child's First Name` = col_character(),

Produce a well-structured, reader-friendly table showing the rank in
popularity of the name “Olivia” as a female baby name over time; this
should have rows for ethnicities and columns for year. Produce a similar
table showing the most popular name among male children over time.

``` r

    ## 4 HISPANIC                   Liam   Liam   Liam   Jayden Jayden Jayden

**Answer** The most popular boys name is for Asian and Pacific Islander
as well as Hispanic is Jayden, for White is Joseph, for Black are
Jayden, Ethan, and Noah. Therefore, the most popular boy’s name over
time is Jayden.

-----

Finally, for male, white non-hispanic children born in 2016, produce a
scatter plot showing the number of children with a name (y axis) against
the rank in popularity of that name (x axis).

``` r
##Filter out with only male, white non-hispanic children born in 2016

Popular_Baby_Names_Cleaned%>%
  filter( year_of_birth  == 2016 )%>%
    filter(gender == "MALE") %>%
    filter(ethnicity == "WHITE NON HISPANIC")%>%
## Make the plot
  ggplot(aes(x = rank, y = count)) + 
  geom_point() +
ggtitle("For 2016 White boy, the popularity of a name against the number of children with it")+
labs(y="Number of children with a name", x = "Rank in popularity of a name")
```
